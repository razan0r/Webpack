# News Article Evaluation with Natural Language Processing

## Project Description

This project evaluates news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The application analyzes the text of an article and provides insights into its polarity (positive or negative), subjectivity (subjective or factual), and a snippet of the text. The application is built using modern web technologies and follows a structured architecture for ease of maintenance and scalability.

## Project Architecture

- **File Structure**: 
  - `src/views/` or `src/html/` - Contains the HTML file
  - `src/js/` - Contains JavaScript files
  - `src/styles/` or `src/scss/` - Contains stylesheets (SCSS files)
  - `webpack.config.js` - Webpack configuration files for development and production
  - `package.json` - Contains project dependencies and scripts

- **Webpack**:
  - Configured for both development and production modes.
  - The build script generates a `dist` folder with the production build.
  - Dev server setup for local development.
